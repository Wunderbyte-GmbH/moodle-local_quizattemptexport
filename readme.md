# Quizattemptexport

Automatically exports quiz attempts submitted by students into PDF files.

The files can be exported in two ways:
* Into the moodle file system, where they may be viewed/downloaded through the browser
* Into a directory within moodledata

To avoid performance impact when a large number of quiz attempts is submitted at the same time, the automatic export will be done by a scheduled task in the background.

You may also manually export any quiz attempt within the system, using the user interface hooked into the quiz instance administration. This is also where you may view and download the files from your browser.


> **Note:** This version supports **Debian 12 Bookworm (arm64)** architecture!
